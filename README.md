# nextflow_rna_seq_pipeline
This project is a user-friendly web application built using Streamlit to provide a graphical interface for running an RNA-seq data analysis pipeline powered by Nextflow. The main goal is to make RNA sequencing analysis more accessible to researchers, students, and scientists who may not be comfortable using command-line tools.
